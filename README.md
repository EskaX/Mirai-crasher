# Mirai-crasher


This is a very simple Mirai cnc crasher
this exploit works sending a string times 9999 to a cncs ip and port which should cause a buffer overflow
Works only on Mirai cncs i think. havent tested it on anything else who knows. 
works on most shitty mirais (which is 80% of all mirairs)
